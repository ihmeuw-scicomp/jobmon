Graphical User Interface (GUI)
##############################
The Jobmon GUI allows users to see the status of their workflows.
In general any status query in the CLI is also available in the GUI
and should be easier to find.

The GUI is at: `<https://jobmon-gui.ihme.washington.edu>`_

.. _status-commands-label:

Jobmon Command Line Interface (CLI) Status Commands
###################################################
The Jobmon status commands allow you to check that status of your Workflows and Tasks from the
command line.

To use the status commands:
    1. Open a new terminal window
    2. SSH in to the cluster slogin node
    3. srun
    4. Activate the same conda environment that your tasks are running in

There are currently three supported commands:

workflow_status
***************
    Entering ``jobmon workflow_status`` at the command line will show you
    a table of the number of tasks that are in each state within that workflow. You
    can specify the workflow by user using the -u flag. For example:
    ``jobmon workflow_status -u {user}``. You can also specify the workflow
    using the -w flag. For example: ``jobmon workflow_status -w 9876``.
    You can also use the -w flag to specify multiple workflows at the same
    time. For example, if you have one workflow named 9876 and one
    workflow named 1234 you would enter ``jobmon workflow_status -w 9876 1234``.

workflow_tasks
**************
    Entering ``jobmon workflow_tasks`` in to the command line will show you
    the status of specific tasks in a given workflow. You can specify which
    workflow with the -w flag. For example: ``jobmon workflow_tasks -w 9876``.
    You can also add a -s flag to only query tasks that are in a certain
    state. For example: ``jobmon workflow_tasks -w 9876 -s PENDING`` will query all
    tasks within workflow 9876 that have the pending status. You may also query by multiple
    statuses. For example: ``jobmon workflow_tasks -w 9876 -s PENDING RUNNING``

.. _task_status-commands-label:

task_status
***********
    Entering ``jobmon task_status`` in to the command line will show you the
    state of each task instance for a certain task. You may specify the task
    by adding a -t flag. For example: ``jobmon task_status -t 1234``. You may also filter by
    multiple task ids and statuses. The -s flag will allow you to filter upon a specific status.
    For example, if you wanted to query all task instances in the Done state for task 1234 and
    task 7652 you would do the following ``jobmon task_status -t 1234 7652 -s done``

JSON Flag
*********
    A new flag has been added to the Jobmon CLI to allow users to return their workflow and
    task statuses in JSON format. To use this feature add a ``-n`` flag to any of the Jobmon
    CLI commands. For example: ``jobmon task_status -t 1234 7652 -s done -n``

Possible states: PENDING, RUNNING, DONE, FATAL

task_dependencies
*****************
    Entering ``jobmon task_dependencies`` in to the command line will show users what tasks
    are upstream and downstream of the task provided. Users will specify the task by adding a
    -t flag. For example: ``jobmon task_dependencies -t 1672``. The ouput returned will look
    like::

        Upstream Tasks:

           Task ID         Status
           1               D

        Downstream Tasks:

           Task ID         Status
           3               D
           4               D

get_filepaths
*************

Due to the introduction of array task submission in Jobmon 3.1, sometimes the structure of the output filepaths isn't
intuitive to human operators. Jobmon provides a ``jobmon get_filepaths`` CLI tool to retrieve a more useful representation
of the location of your log files based on the provided compute_resources.

You can filter the results by workflow ID, array name, or job name using the -w, -a, -j flags respectively.
By default the query returns 5 results but you can always increase the limit using the -l flag.

Jobmon Database
###############

Jobmon Database API
*******************

This API allows users to query the database for detailed resource usage information. There are currently two routes:
    1. **/wf_resource_usage** - which allows users to query resource usage by Workflow ID.
    2. **/tool_resource_usage** - which allows users to query resource usage by Tool name.

Base URL
--------

All API requests should be made to the base URL provided on the **"Jobmon at IHME"** page, accessible through
the Jobmon GUI.

Authentication
--------------

Currently, the Database API does not require authentication. In future releases, this may be updated, so check this
section for any changes.

Additional Routes
-----------------
If there are any other routes or features you would like to see in the API, please let the SciComp team know.

Running Queries
***************
If the command line status commands do not provide the information you need,
you can query the Jobmon database.

You can view the Jobmon database connection information here: `<https://jobmon-gui.ihme.washington.edu/#/jobmon_at_ihme>`_

.. include:: database-ihme.rst

.. note::
    Jobmon has a persistent database. This means any time the client side of Jobmon is updated
    it will continue to use the same database. The database credentials will only change when
    database changes are implemented.

You can query the Jobmon database to see the status of a whole Workflow, or any set of tasks.
Open a SQL browser (e.g. Sequel Pro) and connect to the database defined above.

Useful Jobmon Queries
*********************
If you wanted the current status of all Tasks in workflow 191:
    | SELECT status, count(*)
    | FROM task
    | WHERE workflow_id = <workflow_id>
    | GROUP BY status

To find your Workflow if you know the Workflow name:
    | SELECT *
    | FROM workflow
    | WHERE name="<your workflow name>"

To find all of your Workflows by your username:
    | SELECT *
    | FROM workflow
    | JOIN workflow_run ON workflow.id = workflow_run.workflow_id
    | WHERE workflow_run.user = "<your username>"

To get all of the error logs associated with a given Workflow:
    | SELECT *
    | FROM task t1, task_instance t2, task_instance_error_log t3
    | WHERE t1.id = t2.task_id
    | AND t2.id = t3.task_instance_id
    | AND t1.workflow_id = <workflow id>

To get the error logs for a given WorkflowRun:
    | SELECT *
    | FROM task_instance t1, task_instance_error_log t2
    | WHERE t1.id = t2.task_instance_id
    | AND t1.workflow_run_id = <workflow_run_id>
